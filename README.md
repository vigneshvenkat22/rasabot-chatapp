Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. With Rasa, you can build contextual assistants on:
- Facebook Messenger
- Slack
- Google Hangouts
- Webex Teams
- Microsoft Bot Framework
- Rocket.Chat
- Mattermost
- Telegram
- Twilio
- Your own custom conversational channels

or voice assistants as:
- Alexa Skills
- Google Home Actions

Rasa helps you build contextual assistants capable of having layered conversations with
lots of back-and-forth. In order for a human to have a meaningful exchange with a contextual
assistant, the assistant needs to be able to use context to build on things that were previously
discussed – Rasa enables you to build assistants that can do this in a scalable way.
